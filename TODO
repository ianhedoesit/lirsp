I need to deal with all sorts of messy terminal behavior. I should look at

Step 1: Read in arbitrary amount of '(' and ')'.
Step 2: Ensure that there is an equal number of both.
Step 3: Ensure a '(' always comes before a ')'.
Step 4: Proper nesting ['(()) is valid whereas '())(' is not].

IDEA: Use different 'begin'/'end' characters, such as different braces.
